Race Is Not A Social Construct, Race Is Determined By Genetic Markers In Your DNA

This thread is meant to educate people and to give them trustworthy authoritative citations to counter the statement  'Race is A Social Construct ', because scientifically speaking racial differences are very real.

The article that's easiest to understand and favors real scientific data over social science theories comes from a Harvard Genetic Scientist Dr David Reich :  http://archive.fo/FWSVJ

Other scientists who look at the factual data come to the same conclusion, that different races are biologically different from each other.

Other branches of science that acknowledge differences between races exist and are quantifiable enough to be measured are anthropology and police forensics

Race can also be determined from shape of the skull, shape of the nasal region, shape of the eye orbits, and degree of jaw protrusion (Open the PDF)

The conclusion that race is a social construct is well intentioned, but ultimately the science simply doesn't support it. I'll close with a quote from Harvard Geneticist David Reich

Harvard Geneticist David Reich concludes:  'Arguing that no substantial differences among human populations are possible will only invite the racist misuse of genetics that we wish to avoid.' http://archive.fo/FWSVJ#selection-575.161-575.307
