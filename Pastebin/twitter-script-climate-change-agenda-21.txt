The entire Climate Change initiative is nothing more than imaginary boogeyman designed to scare people giving up their freedoms peacefully & accepting global socialist rule. The science isn't settled in fact there's overwhelming evidence it's been manipulated (1/37)

Agenda 21 is one of the original documents with a plan to use Climate Change to enact political change things like Ocazio-Cortez New Green Deal are just updated versions of the original UN Agenda 21 (2/37)

Globalist Groups like the UN & EU see Climate Change as an effective & expedient way to peacefully get people to surrender their freedoms & to get nations to surrender their sovereignty & accept socialist globalist rule (3/37)



This is the official UN document for Agenda 21 it's long & wordy & uses complicated language to describe things. You may want to read some of the summary material as it's a lot easier to understand (4/37)

This is a 6 page easy to read pamphlet that addresses what Americans would be giving up under Agenda 21, it comes from The Huffington Post of all places (5/37)

Here's a frightening look at how under Agenda 21 your ability to own real estate & private property would be constrained. You would lose many personal freedoms as well (6/37)

A group of California Democrats built a website pointing out many of the radical changes Agenda 21 would bring to Americans & how it would completely change society as we know it (7/37)

The push to get people to stop eating meat reducing air travel reducing car ownership eliminating air conditioning & single family housing are all goals of Agenda 21 (8/37)

For Agenda 21 to work a critical mass of people have to believe Climate change is an imminent threat that will make the earth uninhabitable. To achieve this goal Climate Scientists started to manipulate the temperature reporting data (9/37)

When the weather monitoring network was set up stations were set nationwide including remote areas to give an accurate representation of the temperature. Many of these weather stations showed no climate change these "non-compliant" stations were removed (10/37)



Starting in the late 80's NASA and NOAH Climate Scientists began removing the weather stations that were reporting data didn't agree with the climate change agenda (11/37)

In 1988 there were over 6,000 weather reporting stations, by the year 2000 only 3,000 of those original reporting stations existed (12/37)

Here's a scientific study about how the weather stations being removed will provide a less accurate view of global temperatures (13/37)

To make the temperature reporting data more conclusively show a global warming trend the remote "non-compliant" weather stations were replaced with urban ones, mostly at airport facilities (14/37)



These airport weather stations are problematic for a lot of reasons mostly because urban areas are more developed and have higher ambient temperatures. Airports are even worse due to the air travel activity (15/37)



Here's a scientific study showing how an urban bias at weather reporting stations creates an inaccurate picture of climate conditions (16/37)

In 2015 before the Paris Accords, a new study showed rising temperatures. Upon review a 0.3 C discrepancy was mysteriously added to all the NASA satellite data (17/37)

This mysterious 0.3 C temperature increase made climate change seem like 'settled science'. No one can say where this 0.3C came from. The entire Paris Accord was based upon politically motivated falsified data (18/37)



When other scientists demanded access to the data to try & account for the 0.3 C it was reported that the computer containing the data experienced a catastrophic failure & no backups were available (19/37)

The entire Paris Accord agreement causing nations to make changes & spend billions of dollars is based on falsified data that was never independently verified & was mysteriously 'lost' (20/37)

Trying to use Climate Change to affect changes in society is nothing new, and people have been using it as a boogeyman for over 100 years (21/37)

Scientists have been monitoring 700 islands & atolls for over 40 years & none have been lost to Climate Change related flooding. In fact 86% remained the same size or increased land mass (24/37)

Changes in the sea level in places like Miami are the result of changes in geologic pressure, not climate change (25/37)

Many people claim Climate Change is causing more hurricanes to make landfall data from the National Hurricane Center actually show that LESS hurricanes have been making landfall since the 1960s (26/37)

The increased hurricane damage you see on the news isn't caused by stronger hurricanes making landfall but by greedy developers building in areas that were previously deemed too high risk to develop (27/37)

Every few years politicians make a big push to get people to support social & political change based the impending doom of Climate Change. UN Agenda 21 UN Agenda 2030 The Paris Accords & Ocasio's New Green Deal are just different versions of the same thing (28/37)

The latest is United Nations Agenda 2030 in addition to using Climate Change to pressure people, they are forcing recognition trans and non-binary gender acceptance (29/37)

UN Agenda 2030 also known as The Agenda For Sustainable Development Goals SDG has 17 major points & it's structured in such a way that you can't pick & choose which goals to implement you have to try & implement them all (30/37)



The UN SDG talks about fixing poverty, famine, housing, and education, the problem is it plans to achieve this through an authoritarian socialist global regime (31/37)



You won't be able to own property or live where you want. Once the government provides your housing, they can flood your neighborhood with refugees and you have no means to move to escape to a cleaner safer neighborhood (32/37)



On the surface all of the SDG goals seem perfectly reasonable but when you scratch below the surface you realize it's all about tricking you into peacefully giving up your freedoms & national sovereignty under the lie of sacrificing to save the planet (33/37)



Since the government provides your housing you won't be able to have a car & will be forced to use mass transit to get around. Stripped of your ability to move freely you will have no choice but to accept the living conditions forced upon you by globalist rule (34/37)



Another SDG goal is to cure hunger & famine they will achieve this by saying what you can & can't eat & by rationing your quantities. All of the articles about not eating beef & starting to eat bugs are to start getting you used to the idea (35/37)



Climate Change looks like 'settled science' because the data has been manipulated to produce that result. By removing weather stations that disagreed with Climate Change agenda they eliminated the data that could prove it is a lie (36/37)
https://notrickszone.com/2017/02/13/more-data-manipulation-by-noaa-nasa-hadcrut-cooling-the-past-warming-the-present/


Climate Change is Globalist Propaganda whose end goal is to manipulate you into thinking you need to sacrifice your personal freedom & self-governance to save the planet. It's a lie built on heavily manipulated data designed to look irrefutable (37/37)
