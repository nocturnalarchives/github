Other scientists who look at the factual data come to the same conclusion, that different races are biologically different from each other (11/38)



Harvard Geneticist David Reich: 'But as a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among races.' archive.fo/FWSVJ#selection-427.0-427.219 (12/38)
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html


David Reich Harvard Genetic Scientist: 'With the help of these tools we are learning that while race may be a social construct differences in genetic ancestry that happen to correlate to many of todayâ€™s racial constructs are real.' (13/38)

David Reich: 'well-meaning people who deny the possibility of substantial biological differences among human populations are digging themselves into an indefensible position one that will not survive the onslaught of science ' (14/38)
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html


David Reich Genetic Scientist: 'Recent genetic studies have demonstrated differences across populations not just in the genetic determinants of simple traits such as skin color but also in more complex traits like bodily dimensions' (15/38)
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html


David Reich raises the taboo subject of intelligence & race 'And since all traits influenced by genetics are expected to differ across populations the genetic influences on behavior & cognition will differ across populations too ' (16/38)
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html


You will sometimes hear that any biological differences among populations are likely to be small because humans have diverged too recently from common ancestors for substantial differences to have manifested. This is not true. (17/38)

David Reich Harvard Genetic Scientist: '.in the coming years genetic studies will show that many traits are influenced by genetic variations & that these traits will differ on average across human populations ' archive.fo/FWSVJ#selection-545.49-545.220 (18/38)

Taking a step back and exploring the 7 different ancestral groupings mentioned above also highlights some other interesting and noteworthy points. (19/38)

Intelligence differences among different races is something scientists shy away from, but race playing a role in healthcare issues are much easier to find (23/38)



If you need stem cell treatment or a bone marrow transplant, finding a donor who is the same race as you really matters (archive.fo/nc5wJ#selection-933.0-933.237) (24/38)

For people who are mixed race the odds of finding a successful donor is a lot more challenging (archive.fo/AlDnK#selection-977.1-977.586) (25/38)

According to Be The Match, a registry service for finding donors, only 4% of the people in their database are mixed race (archive.fo/ZqqWG#selection-5085.1-5085.71) (26/38)

How much does a same race donor matter? According to Be The Match National Registry a same race donor can have up to an 80% success rate. A different race donor can be as low as a 19% success rate archive.fo/gBIy0#selection-4329.0-4329.167 (27/38)

Harvard Geneticist David Reich notes that since all human traits are influenced by genetics intelligence & cognition will be as well archive.fo/FWSVJ#selection-499.51-499.318 (29/38)

Other branches of science that acknowledge differences between races exist and are quantifiable enough to be measured are anthropology and police forensics (30/38)



Forensic Anthropologists can use human skeletal remains to tell the gender, and race and age at the time of death (31/38)

https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article-abstract/29/7/423/2504031


Race can also be determined from shape of the skull, shape of the nasal region, shape of the eye orbits, and degree of jaw protrusion (32/38)

From a police forensics lab & anthropological standpoint it is becoming easier to identify someones race from their skeleton bit.ly/2I5XHsy (33/38)

Using hair collected from a crime scene can help the police determine a suspects gender and race (archive.fo/sPlhB#selection-715.0-721.297) (34/38)

If race were a social construct how could police forensic labs use it to identify victims and suspected criminals? (35/38)

The conclusion that race is a social construct is well intentioned, but ultimately the science simply doesn't support it. I'll close with a quote from Harvard Geneticist David Reich (36/38)



Harvard Geneticist David Reich concludes: 'Arguing that no substantial differences among human populations are possible will only invite the racist misuse of genetics that we wish to avoid.' archive.fo/FWSVJ#selection-575.161-575.307 (37/38)
